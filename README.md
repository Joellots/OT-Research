# Covert Channels, C2, and ML-Based Detection of CTC

This project explores **covert post-exploitation techniques** and proposes a **machine learning-based approach** for detecting **Covert Timing Channels (CTCs)**. It combines offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices in a practical, research-driven setting.

## 🔧 Project Structure

### 1. **Post-Exploitation & Covert C2 Channel**

* Exploits `CVE-2020-2555` on Oracle Coherence via Metasploit.
* Deploys a custom C2 agent (`VSAgent`) that abuses the `__VIEWSTATE` parameter in HTTP to send/receive commands.
* C2 server mimics legitimate ASP.NET traffic to evade detection.

### 2. **Detection of Covert Timing Channels (CTCs)**

* Captures network traffic and converts it into image-like features.
* Trains ML models (Decision Tree, ANN, SVM) to classify traffic as **normal** or **covert**.
* Uses 16×16 IAT-based image matrices and statistical feature extraction.

## Key Insights

* **Decision Tree** achieved 100% detection of covert traffic.
* **ANN and SVM** models failed to detect covert traffic due to class imbalance (only 3 covert samples in test set).
